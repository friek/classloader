Class initializer
=================

This project intends to create a lightweight dependency injection system with features also found in CDI (Java) and
the Spring framework (also Java).

In the current state, it is completely unusable. This is just a start to see if I can build this thing to suite
my needs.

Nevertheless, pull requests are welcome ;)
